I am an atmospheric scientist currently working as a postdoctoral appointee at Sandia National Laboratories. My research interests involve large-scale atmospheric modeling, clouds and their interaction with the climate system, and remote sensing of cloud properties. A lot of my work has been focused on the use of satellite instrument simulators to account for limitations in remote sensing retrievals of cloud properties in order to enable more robust evaluation of large-scale models. More recently, my attention has turned to the Arctic and understanding processes important to the formation of mixed-phase clouds, how these clouds affect the radiative balance and the climate system, and how we can improve the simulation of the statistics of these clouds in large-scale (global) models.

Outside of science, I enjoy playing hockey, competitive olympic-style weightlifting, and all things outdoors.
