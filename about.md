I am an atmospheric scientist working at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. My research interests include large-scale atmospheric modeling, clouds and cloud radiative effects, and remote sensing of cloud properties. Previous work has been focused on the use of satellite instrument simulators to account for limitations in remote sensing retrievals of cloud properties in order to enable more robust evaluation of large-scale models. More recently I have gotten involved in model development, and currently work on two Department of Energy efforts to push large-scale modeling to cloud resolving scales using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM).

Outside of science, I enjoy playing hockey and all things outdoors.
